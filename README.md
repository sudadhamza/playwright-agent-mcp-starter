# QA Playwright TypeScript MCP Boilerplate

[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/ErkanBarin/qa-playwright-ts-mcp-boilerplate/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ErkanBarin/qa-playwright-ts-mcp-boilerplate/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Production-ready starter for **UI + API test automation** with Playwright, TypeScript, Page Object Model, and AI-powered Claude Code agents via MCP.

---

## Who It's For

- **Jr QA Engineers** who want a clean, opinionated Playwright + TypeScript starting point
- **Sr SDETs** who want a batteries-included template with AI agent tooling and MCP integration
- **Teams** that want repeatable PR workflows — small scope, stable selectors, no flaky sleeps

---

## What's Included

- **UI testing** — Playwright Test with Page Object Model, custom fixtures, cross-browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **API testing** — Playwright `request` API for HTTP testing, plus optional Postman/Newman skeleton
- **11 AI agents** — Claude Code agents for test design, PR hygiene, security scanning, flake triage, coverage analysis, and more
- **2 MCP servers** — `@playwright/mcp` (browser automation) + Playwright Test MCP (test runner)
- **Docs library** — QA conventions, prompt library, PR workflow, security sanitization, MCP setup

---

## 5-Minute Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Use this template (click "Use this template" on GitHub) — or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/ErkanBarin/qa-playwright-ts-mcp-boilerplate.git
cd qa-playwright-ts-mcp-boilerplate

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → set BASE_URL to your app (defaults to http://example.com)

# 4. Set up MCP (optional, for Claude Code users)
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json

# 5. Install browsers
npx playwright install

# 6. Run one UI test (proof it works)
npx playwright test tests/ui/smoke.spec.ts --project=chromium

# 7. Run one API test
npx playwright test tests/api/health.spec.ts --project=chromium

# 8. See the HTML report
npm run report
```

> **Note:** The defaults are `http://example.com` (UI) and `https://httpbin.org` (API) — all 10 tests pass out of the box against these public URLs. Change them in `.env` to point to your application.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm test` | Run all tests (all browsers) |
| `npm run test:ui` | Run UI tests only |
| `npm run test:api` | Run API tests only |
| `npm run test:debug` | Run with Playwright Inspector |
| `npm run report` | Open the HTML test report |
| `npm run lint` | Lint TypeScript files |

---

## AI Agents

11 Claude Code agents are included to accelerate QA workflows. They work inside Claude Code (CLI or VS Code extension).

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `qa-orchestrator` | Coordinates all specialist agents |
| `ui-test-designer` | Designs UI test cases from user stories |
| `api-coverage-planner` | Plans API test coverage from endpoints |
| `pr-hygiene` | Checks PR quality and standards |
| `security-scout` | Scans for secrets and vulnerabilities |
| `coverage-hunter` | Finds test coverage gaps |
| `flake-triage` | Diagnoses and fixes flaky tests |
| `ci-reporter` | Parses CI output into summaries |
| `docs-writer` | Generates and updates documentation |
| `mcp-explorer` | Discovers MCP server capabilities |
| `seed-data-manager` | Manages test data and fixtures |

### Copy-Paste Prompts

```
Design UI tests for the login page following POM pattern. Check existing
page objects first, then create missing ones. Tag all tests @ui @smoke.
```

```
Scan this repo for hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens, and internal URLs.
Report findings with file paths and line numbers.
```

```
Analyze test coverage gaps. Map page objects and API endpoints to existing
tests. Show what's untested and prioritize by risk.
```

See [docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md](docs/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md) for the full prompt library.

## MCP Setup

Two MCP servers connect Claude Code to your browser and test runner:

| Server | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `playwright` | Navigate, click, fill, screenshot, inspect DOM |
| `playwright-test` | Run tests, get results, manage execution |

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
```

See [docs/MCP_SETUP.md](docs/MCP_SETUP.md) for prerequisites, VS Code extensions, and a sanity check walkthrough.

---

## CI

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs all Playwright tests on every push and PR to `main`.

It works out of the box — no configuration needed.

See [.github/workflows/playwright.yml](.github/workflows/playwright.yml) for the workflow definition.
